<h2><s>Currency Converter</s> Day Templates</h2>
<h3>Progression/Thoughts</h3>
<p>I started working on the day template this day instead of the currency converter. <br>
The plan was to finish the template and then work on the converter but what actually ended up happening was that <br>
I ended up doing my circuits homework from 2pm - 6am and so i couldn't work on the converter. Will have to make it another day!<br>
The actually code itself though is fine. Each time i create a file it takes the day number from that and automaticially names the file and puts the <br>
Date on the page and the download link and stuff. Its very nice. </p>

<a href="day#.html" id="download_code" download>Code!</a>

      let file_location = location.pathname.split("/")
      file_location = file_location[file_location.length-1].split(".")
      file_location.pop()
      file_location = file_location[0].split("y")
      
      console.log(file_location)
      day = file_location[1]
      console.log(day)
      day = Number(day)  
      let current_date = new Date(2024,0,26) 
      current_date.setDate(current_date.getDate()+Number(day)-1)
      console.log(current_date)
      document.getElementById("download_code").href = "day"+day+".html"
      let string_date = "Day " + day + " (" + current_date.getMonth() + "/" + current_date.getDate() + "/" + current_date.getFullYear() +")"
      document.getElementById("day_title").innerHTML=  string_date
      document.getElementById("day_heading").innerHTML = document.getElementById("day_title").innerHTML
